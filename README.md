# YT Music Controller

A workflow for Alfred that allows you to control YouTube Music in the Arc browser. It supports basic playback actions, such as play, pause, next, and previous, as well as opening your liked songs or playlists.

For now, only the Arc browser is supported. Other browsers may be added in the future.

## Features

- **Detect Default Browser**: Automatically detects your default browser or lets you specify one (supports Arc).
- **Liked Songs Playback**:
  - Play your liked songs.
  - Play your liked songs in shuffle mode.
- **Playback Controls**:
  - Play/Pause YouTube Music.
  - Skip to the next or previous song.
- **Playlist Support**:
  - Launch your custom playlists by keyword.

## Commands

| **Keyword** | **Description**                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `liked`     | Launch your liked songs playlist.               |
| `likedr`    | Launch your liked songs in shuffle mode.        |
| `play`      | Play or pause YouTube Music.                    |
| `pause`     | Alias for `play`.                               |
| `next`      | Skip to the next song.                          |
| `previous`  | Skip to the previous song.                      |
| `p1`        | Launch your custom playlist #1.                 |
| `p1r`       | Launch your custom playlist #1 in shuffle mode. |

## Installation

1. **Download**: Clone or download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/raphaelMrci/yt-music-controller).
2. **Import Workflow**: Open Alfred and import the `.alfredworkflow` file.
3. **Setup Browser** (Optional):
   - By default, the workflow tries to detect your browser.
   - To manually specify a browser, open the configuration and set `browser_name` to the desired browser.
   - If your browser is not in the list, it means it's not supported yet.

## How It Works

1. **Browser Detection**:
   - The workflow attempts to detect your default browser.
   - You can override this behavior by specifying `browser_name`.

2. **Liked Songs & Shuffle**:
   - The workflow uses AppleScript to open the YouTube Music tab in the specified browser.
   - It interacts with the menu and shuffle options using injected JavaScript.

3. **Playback Controls**:
   - Controls playback (play/pause, next, previous) via YouTube Music's active tab.

4. **Custom Playlists**:
   - Define and play your custom playlists using keywords like `p1` or `p1r`.

## Dependencies

- **macOS**: Required for AppleScript.
- **Alfred Powerpack**: Required to import and use the workflow.
- **Supported Browsers**:
  - Arc (default)
  - Google Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari

## Troubleshooting

- **YT Music Tab Not Found**:
  - Ensure youâ€™re logged into YouTube Music in your browser.
  - Verify that the browser specified in `browser_name` is installed.
